# Read

frostread is a tailnet-only feed reader and read-later list. It runs behind
[lodge](https://github.com/frostyard/lodge), frostyard's tailnet-only web
shell, as app `read`.

- **Sources.** RSS, Atom and JSON Feed, by URL or from a page's
  `<link rel="alternate">`, imported and exported as OPML. Each source
  polls every 20 minutes or so, with conditional GET and a per-source
  backoff.
- **Read later.** Save a link from the app, from `readctl save <url>`, or
  from an agent with a `read;write` token.
- **Articles.** The main content is extracted, sanitized, and its images
  are fetched into a content-addressed store and inlined, so the browser
  loads nothing remote. The original bytes are kept as sent.
- **Reading.** Unread, starred and archived views, full-text search, and
  permalinks at `/read/item/<id>`.
- **Save as a note.** A reader button writes the article into notes under
  `Reading/`, through notes' MCP on lodge's agent socket.
- **Agents.** Porter and any other agent reach it at `/mcp/read` with a
  scoped token.

Status: pre-release, private, 2026-10-21. The daemon, its API, `readctl`,
MCP and save-as-note are built; the web app is next. See the
[roadmap](docs/plans/0001-roadmap.md).

## Build

```sh
make check              # tidy, vet, gofmt, lint and tests
make build              # build/readd and build/readctl
make lodge-package      # stage them for lodge under build/lodge-root
make dev-lodge          # lodge's development build on loopback, with Read and Notes
```

`make dev-lodge` starts lodge's development build with frostread and
frostnotes in it, generated feeds and a generated vault, and frostread's
scoped notes token, so save-as-note works end to end. It reads `../lodge`
and `../frostnotes` (`LODGE_DIR`, `NOTES_DIR`) and changes neither. See
`scripts/dev-lodge.sh`.

The web bundle builds only in an nsl machine with Node, never on the host:

```sh
make web-build
```

## How it runs behind lodge

lodge owns every network listener. `readd` serves:

| Socket or route | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/run/lodge/apps/read.sock` | lodge's app socket: `/health`, `/api`, `/content/`, `/mcp` |
| `/run/frostread/readctl.sock` | `readctl`, the CLI |
| `https://CONTENT/read/<path>` | an article's content page, sandboxed |

It runs as user `frostread`, in groups `lodge-apps` and `lodge-agents`,
and listens on no network. Its state is `/var/lib/frostread`, and its
configuration is `/etc/frostread/frostread.json`
(`docs/specs/api.md`).
